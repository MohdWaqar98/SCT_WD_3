# Tic Tac Toe Game | SkillCraft Technology Task 3

## Project Overview
This project is a simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built as part of **SkillCraft Technology Task 3**. The game allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid.
